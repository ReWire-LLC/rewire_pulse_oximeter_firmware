# rewire_pulse_oximeter_firmware

This repository contains firmware for the ReWire pulse oximeter. 

Pre-requisites to building this firmware:

1. You need a ReWire pulse oximeter device.
2. The Arduino IDE must be installed.
3. You must download the ReWire board definitions. Make sure you have the ReWire board definitions added to your Arduino IDE. For more information, go to the board definitions repository at the following link: https://github.com/ReWire-LLC/rewire_board_definitions
4. Download this repository

After you have met the pre-requisites, take the following steps to build the firmware:

1. In the Arduino IDE, make sure that you set your "Sketchbook location" (in the Arduino IDE preferences) to be the _Dependencies_ folder of this repository.
2. Click the compile/build button in the Arduino IDE.
